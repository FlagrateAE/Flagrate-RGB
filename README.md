<p align="center">Python + Arduino project for the ones that want to add some color to their workplace</p>



<h2 id="technologies">ðŸ’» Technologies</h2>

- Python
- C++ (Arduino)
- IR communication (NEC protocol)

<h2 id="started">ðŸš€ Getting started</h2>

This project consists of 2 parts: local-side (Python) and microcontroller-side (Arduino)

#### Local-side 
Logins to user's Spotify account to collect user's current playing track. If any detected, extracts album's cover image most vibrant color with complex algorithm to display on user's RGB light source.

<b>You're probably looking for this part if you want to reuse it.</b>

#### Microcontroller-side
Highly narrowly focused and dependent on the RGB light source and microcontroller.

Uses "IRremote.h" Arduino library to send IR commands to the RGB light source (RGB LED strip in my case). Receives commands sent via serial communication from the local-side. Requires IR LED to work. 

<b>You should probably customize this part for your case.</b>
